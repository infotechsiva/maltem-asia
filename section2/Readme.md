# On-Premises Web Application Deployment

## Hardware or VM Requirements

1. **Hardware**: will decide as per web application's expected workload, including CPU, RAM, and storage. (hardware configuration should slightely higher than required.)

   OR

2. **Virtual Machine (VM)**: If we use virtualization, will set up a VM with hardware resources allocated based on the application's needs. Virtualization platforms like VMware or VirtualBox can be used.

## Operating System Selection

- **Linux (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat)**: will prefer centos as it is like amazon linux

- **Windows Server**: Suitable for app that require Windows-specific technologies.

## Deployment Process

1. **Install the Selected OS**:

2. **Configure Networking**: will assign a static IP address to ensure consistent accessibility.

3. **Install Web Server Software**: Install web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, tomcat) on the server.

4. **Deploy the Web Application**:  Transfer application files using secure methods (e.g., SCP, SFTP, WinSCP). or can use ansible to deploy app pkg

5. **Set Up Database (if needed)**:  Install and configure the database software (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

6. **Configure Firewall Rules**:  setup firewall settings to allow incoming traffic on necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443) and restrict access.

## Security and Updates

1. **Regular Updates**: Implement a patch management process for OS and software updates. (generellay quatrly patching )

2. **Firewall and Security Policies**: Configure firewalls and apply security best practices.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging tools for performance and security monitoring. (will prefer loki+grafana)

4. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Establish a backup strategy and disaster recovery plan. (we can take snapshot also in vmware)

5. **User Access Control**: using LDAP implement user access control and limit privileges.

6. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments periodically.

7. **Network Security**: Implement network security measures, including intrusion detection and prevention systems.(using WAZUH, suricata, SIEM)
